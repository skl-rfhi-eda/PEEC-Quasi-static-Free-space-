# PEEC-Quasi-static-Free-space-
This is the first open source version of PEEC of our group. Its a quasi-static model for free-space electromagnetic problem. It gives equivalent circuit model conductors in a free-space. Gmsh is required as input (old version). .sp file and S-parameter simulation can be the output. The GUI are developping and will come soon.
